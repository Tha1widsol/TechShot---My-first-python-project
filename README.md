# TechShot---My-first-python-project
This is a 2D shooter game in which the aim is to complete all 3 levels by defeating enemies and bosses. The levels all have different map/character designs and the game itself is pretty difficult.
This game also has a feature for players to register an account or login to retain progress.

I coded this game about 2 years ago when I first learned the basic fundamentals of pygame, So most of the code written is horribly inefficient. However, I just want to share my first project online and I want to see what you guys think. The @ button doesn't even work and you can't even enter uppercase letters in the login/register page lol.

How to Install / Setup the game:

1. Install Python (Ideally the latest version)
2. Setup pip(You can checkout a tutorial online if you're unsure. Once this is done, type "pip" in the cmd prompt and press enter. It should state which version it is)
3. Install pygame by typing in "pip install pygame" and press enter in the cmd prompt
4. Download/Extract all the files from the game on this site
5. Run the "TechShot.exe" file
6. Enjoy!

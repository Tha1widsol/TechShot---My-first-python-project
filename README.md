# TechShot---My-first-python-project
This is a 2D shooter game in which the aim is to complete all 3 levels by defeating enemies and bosses. The levels all have different map/character designs and the game itself is pretty difficult.

I coded this game about 2 years ago when I first learned the basic fundamentals of pygame, So most of the code written is horribly inefficient. However, I just want to share my first project online and I want to see what you guys think. 

How to Install / Setup the game:

1. Download/Extract all the game files from the site on your computer
2. Run the "TechShot.exe" file
3. Enjoy!

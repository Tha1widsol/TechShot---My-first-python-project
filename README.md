# TechShot---My-first-python-project
This is a 2D shooter game in which the aim is to complete all 3 levels by defeating enemies and bosses. The levels all have different designs and the game itself is pretty difficult.
This game also has a feature for players to register an account or login to retain progress.

I coded this game about 2 years ago when I first learned the basic fundamentals of pygame, So most of the code written is horribly inefficient. However, I just want to share my first project online and I want to see what you guys think.
